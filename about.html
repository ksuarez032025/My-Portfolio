          <h2>
            Career Experience & Technical Growth
          </h2>
          <p>
            With over 14 years of experience in the financial services industry, I built my career leading card
            operations, payments processing, and fraud mitigation at a credit union level. As the Card Services Manager
            at Empower
            Federal Credit Union, I was responsible for overseeing Mastercard credit and debit card programs, managing
            processor
            and product conversions, and launching mobile wallet integrations like Google Pay and Samsung Pay. I played
            a
            key role in optimizing dispute workflows through Salesforce and monitoring fraud trends using Power BI
            dashboards.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            One of my most impactful contributions came through close collaboration with our internal application
            services team. I served as a bridge between card operations and the technical teams — testing new workflows,
            validating daily
            file generation processes, and ensuring API integrations were mapped accurately to the correct data points.
            I
            worked hands-on with system functionality, catching errors before they reached production, and helping
            translate
            operational needs into clean technical executions.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            I regularly collaborated with departments across the credit union, including accounting for chargebacks &
            daily settlement tracking, commercial lending (business credit cards), compliance, internal audit, and
            lending
            quality control. My passion for understanding how people interact with systems became my greatest strength:
            bridging
            human workflows with the technologies that powered them. That drive to solve operational challenges through
            streamlined tech solutions is what ultimately sparked my transition into coding and development.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            I'm currently focused on front-end development through SheCodes, where I'm learning to build responsive,
            accessible websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My past experience collaborating with
            departments with the
            financial industry taught me how to identify process pain points and work across teams to implement
            system-level
            solutions. That same mindset now drives how I approach development — with an emphasis on clean structure,
            usability, and
            cross-functional impact. From building user-first designs to integrating APIs, I'm excited to fuse my
            financial expertise with modern web technologies to create intuitive, scalable, and secure digital
            experiences for
            real-world operations.

            Staying Centered in a Fast-Paced World
          </h2>
          <p>
            Working in the fast-paced world of finance, payments, and now tech, I've come to value the importance of
            staying grounded. While I thrive on challenge and change, maintaining balance is essential for staying
            energized,
            focused, and at my best — for myself, my family, and my work.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            My reset button lives in the garden — a space that reminds me to slow down, reconnect, and return to what
            matters. Whether I’m outside with my husband and our dogs or teaching my son how to grow food, cook, and
            bake from
            scratch, these moments are grounding. They reflect the same values I bring to my work: patience, curiosity,
            and
            intention. </p>

            Now, through SheCodes, I’m building responsive websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I bring the
